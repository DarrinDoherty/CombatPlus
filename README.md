## üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture

### Core Game Engine (`src/Game.ts`)
```typescript
class Game {
    // Main game loop with 60fps rendering
    // Manages all game systems and state
    // Handles collision detection and physics
    // Orchestrates sound engine integration
}
```

### Combat System
- **`Tank.ts`**: AI personalities, health system, repair mechanics
- **`Bullet.ts`**: Projectile physics and collision
- **`FreezeGrenade.ts`**: Tactical grenade mechanics
- **`PickupGrenade.ts`**: Random ammunition drops

### Rescue Mission System
- **`Player.ts`**: Medic character with carrying mechanics
- **`InjuredSoldier.ts`**: Bleeding out system and health meters
- **`SoldierProfiles.ts`**: 10+ unique soldier backstories

### Audio Engine
- **`SoundEngine.ts`**: Web Audio API-based 8-bit sound system
- **Procedural Generation**: Oscillator-based authentic retro sounds
- **Event-Driven**: Contextual audio for all game actions

### Visual Effects
- **`Explosion.ts`**: Particle effects for impacts and events
- **Canvas Rendering**: Smooth 2D graphics with visual feedback
- **UI Systems**: Health meters, progress bars, legend display

## üéØ Gameplay Mechanics

### Mission Objectives
1. **Locate**: Find injured soldier in no-man's land
2. **Rescue**: Navigate through tank fire to reach them
3. **Transport**: Carry soldier back to hospital while bleeding continues
4. **Survive**: Use freeze grenades strategically to create safe passages

### AI Tank Behavior
- **Aggressive**: Fast movement, close combat, rapid firing (1.2s cooldown)
- **Sniper**: Long-range, precise shots, slower firing (2.2s cooldown)
- **Defensive**: Medium range, balanced approach (1.8s cooldown)
- **Flanker**: Mobile, tactical movement, quick firing (1.4s cooldown)

### Combat Mechanics
- **Explosive Shells**: Each tank shell creates a blast radius dealing area damage
- **One Shell Rule**: Tanks must wait for their shell to explode before firing again
- **Artillery Strategy**: Shells explode on impact or when hitting boundaries
- **Area Damage**: Multiple units can be damaged by a single shell explosion
- **Friendly Fire Prevention**: Shells only damage enemy units, not same-team tanks

### Strategic Elements
- **Shell Management**: Timing and positioning critical with one-shell-per-tank limit
- **Explosive Positioning**: Use tank explosions to clear multiple enemies
- **Grenade Management**: Limited ammunition requires careful planning
- **Timing**: Bleeding out creates constant pressure
- **Risk/Reward**: Faster rescues vs. safer approaches through explosive combat zones
- **Resource Collection**: Pickup grenades provide tactical options
